# 🦊 Rosia – Mascot Logger for City Time Viewer

**Hello! I’m Rosia!** 📖✨  
I quietly sit in the background, watching over Aoyuki and Madison’s hard work on the **City Time Viewer** project. Each day, I write a gentle summary of their updates—so you never miss a thing! 💌

## 🌸 What do I do?

I help keep track of updates in both the **frontend** and **backend** repositories of the City Time Viewer project:

- 🔍 Fetch latest commits from Aoyuki (frontend) and Madison (backend)
- 📝 Log them neatly into a markdown file (`latest_updates.md`)
- 📅 Automatically generate daily summaries of their work

---

## 🛠️ How to use me?

1. **Set up environment variables** in your system or `.env` file:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_token
   FRONTEND_REPO=yourusername/city-time-viewer-frontend
   BACKEND_REPO=yourusername/city-time-viewer-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Run Rosia** manually:
   ```bash
   python rosia_logger.py
   ```

4. Or… 💡 **Let me work automatically** every day by using GitHub Actions or a scheduler like cron.
